# Eloquence Vector DB - Learning Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements
- [x] Basic vector storage
- [x] Cosine similarity search (dot product with normalization)
- [x] Multiple distance metrics (Cosine, Dot Product, Euclidean)
- [ ] Persistence (save/load to disk)
- [ ] Metadata storage & filtering

## Phase 2: Indexing (The heart of vector DBs)
- [ ] IVF (Inverted File Index) - Clustering-based ANN
- [ ] HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) - Graph-based ANN
- [ ] Product Quantization (PQ) - Vector compression

## Phase 3: Production Features
- [ ] Batch operations
- [ ] Multi-threading
- [ ] Memory-mapped files
- [ ] API layer (HTTP/gRPC)
